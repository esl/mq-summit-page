<p><br />
We’ve got you covered. We’ve been singing from the LiveView hymn sheet for years now
and we’re pretty confident that you could become a LiveView evangelist too but first, here’s why we think it’s so great:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, LiveView is essentially an expansive library that lends itself to rich real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML</li>
  <li>It offers a greatly simplified programming model when compared to JavaScript alternatives and LiveView-powered applications are stateful on the server with bidirectional communication through WebSockets</li>
  <li>LiveView singlehandedly transcended what developers thought of Elixir worldwide</li>
  <li>Finally, it set the path for moving Elixir from a server-side technology to the powerful full-stack ecosystem that it is today.</li>
</ul>

<p>So without further ado here are some brilliant videos we’ve collected over the years from past ElixirConf events on Phoenix LiveView:</p>

These frameworks open doors to the community and expand the capabilities of the ecosystem, making it easier for even more developers to do a wider array of tasks in Elixir. At our June edition, we heard first hand about the updates, capabilities and future plans for five exciting new frameworks. If you’re always looking for new projects or ways to expand your Elixir skill set, make sure you <a href="https://www.elixirconf.eu/#register" title="tickets">get tickets to our next edition of ElixirConf EU Virtual on October 7-8.</a></p>

<p>If you missed the June event, you can catch up on the latest frameworks below.</p>

<p><strong>Crawly - Oleg Tarasenko</strong></p>

<p>Big data is a growing area of interest and investment for businesses around the world. From machine learning to research, the ability to gather broad, reliable datasets is in high demand. Crawly, is a new Elixir framework that allows you to perform data scraping activities using Elixir. Hear from its creator, Oleg Tarasenko below. And, if that interests you, you can view a walkthrough of how to complete a task using crawly on the<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/webinars.html#how-to-use-web-scraping-in-elixir-to-gather-useful-data-erlang-solutions-webinar-58"> Erlang Solutions webinar.</a></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Scenic - Boyd Multerer</strong></p>

<p>Created by Boyd Multerer (the inventor of Xbox Live), the Scenic framework is a native graphic interface for Elixir. Scenic gives Elixir developers the ability to easily build applications that operate identically across all supported operating systems, including MacOS, Ubuntu, Nerves/Linux, and more. Scenic’s main focus is IoT devices but it can also be used to build portable applications. In his talk, Boyd looks to the future of Scenic and fills you in on changes you can look forward to in the upcoming updates. Learn more in the video below.</p>

<p><strong>Lumen - Hans Elias Josephsen</strong></p>

<p>Lumen is the latest Elixir framework to improve the ease of use for front-end use cases. It is a new compiler and runtime suitable for any BEAM language that is compatible with WebAssembly. In this talk, Hans introduces the Lumen project with a specific focus on the compiler.</p>

<p><strong>Membrane Framework - Marcin Lewandowski</strong></p>

<p>Media processing requires a large amount of data, a huge variety of formats, protocols and standards. This has always made it challenging to work with. In this talk, Marcin Lewandowski, creator of the Membrane Elixir Framework, demonstrates how it can be used to process multimedia without headaches, using an example from media streaming.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Pelemay - Susumu Yamazaki</strong></p>

<p>Pelamay has been available since mid-May 2020. It can compile Enum.map in parallel with an integer and (or) a float calculation or String.replace into native code with SIMD instructions. The result is an increase in speed from Enum of between2.25x to 4.48x. In this talk, Susumu Yamazaki, Pelemay’s co-creator shows of what Pelemay can do with demonstrations as well as discussing something that we will see in the near future.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve got you covered. We’ve been singing from the LiveView hymn sheet for years now
and we’re pretty confident that you could become a LiveView evangelist too but first, here’s why we think it’s so great:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, LiveView is essentially an expansive library that lends itself to rich real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It offers a greatly simplified programming model when compared to JavaScript alternatives and LiveView-powered applications are stateful on the server with bidirectional communication through WebSockets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LiveView singlehandedly transcended what developers thought of Elixir worldwide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, it set the path for moving Elixir from a server-side technology to the powerful full-stack ecosystem that it is today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado here are some brilliant videos we’ve collected over the years from past ElixirConf events on Phoenix LiveView:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new in LiveView - Chris McCord, ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VU1JMg9AbLQ&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In January 2020 LiveView saw rapid growth and a ton of new features added which creator Chris McCord takes you through one by one in his update on LiveView.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&amp;amp;A on LiveView - Chris McCord, ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rc_iqnZ05ZE&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this next video, Chris McCord answers audience questions like ‘when you created Pheonix what was the problem you were trying to solve?’ and ‘where does surface fit in with the LiveView landscape?’ Check out the video for all his answers.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer games and collaborative editing with LiveView - Wiebe-Marten Wijnja, ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aErs_DIWxl8&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this talk, Wiebe-Marten Wijnja explains and shares his experiences on how Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView can be used to create web applications in which multiple users are collaborating in real-time-like collaborative document editing and multiplayer games.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoenix LiveView: Interactive Apps without Javascript - Chris McCord, ElixirConf EU 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xJzHq8ru0M&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this talk, Chris McCord walks you through how to take advantage of the many features and functions of Phoenix LiveView. He also explains why there is ‘no need to write Javascript’ with Phoenix LiveView.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending ElixirConf EU 2022 all attendees must complete and sign the waiver form via Whova app or on paper on the conference day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All attendees must present &lt;strong&gt;one of the following&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A negative COVID test dated no more than 72 hours prior to the conference (both quick test and PCR test are accepted)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of vaccination (either in writing, on a card, or on the NHS app - QR code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also ask you to sign:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A waiver form signed a day prior to the conference via conference app or signed on paper on the day of the conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not attend if you or anyone you have been in contact with has shown any symptoms of COVID 72 hours prior. If you click “Yes” on any item on the waiver form, you will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be admitted to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who cannot attend in person can receive a full refund by contacting us up-to a month before the conference or exchange the in-person ticket to a virtual one and receive the reimbursement of the difference in the tickets’ prices.

These frameworks open doors to the community and expand the capabilities of the ecosystem, making it easier for even more developers to do a wider array of tasks in Elixir. At our June edition, we heard first hand about the updates, capabilities and future plans for five exciting new frameworks. If you’re always looking for new projects or ways to expand your Elixir skill set, make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elixirconf.eu/#register&quot; title=&quot;tickets&quot;&gt;get tickets to our next edition of ElixirConf EU Virtual on October 7-8.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you missed the June event, you can catch up on the latest frameworks below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crawly - Oleg Tarasenko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big data is a growing area of interest and investment for businesses around the world. From machine learning to research, the ability to gather broad, reliable datasets is in high demand. Crawly, is a new Elixir framework that allows you to perform data scraping activities using Elixir. Hear from its creator, Oleg Tarasenko below. And, if that interests you, you can view a walkthrough of how to complete a task using crawly on the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/webinars.html#how-to-use-web-scraping-in-elixir-to-gather-useful-data-erlang-solutions-webinar-58&quot;&gt; Erlang Solutions webinar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scenic - Boyd Multerer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created by Boyd Multerer (the inventor of Xbox Live), the Scenic framework is a native graphic interface for Elixir. Scenic gives Elixir developers the ability to easily build applications that operate identically across all supported operating systems, including MacOS, Ubuntu, Nerves/Linux, and more. Scenic’s main focus is IoT devices but it can also be used to build portable applications. In his talk, Boyd looks to the future of Scenic and fills you in on changes you can look forward to in the upcoming updates. Learn more in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lumen - Hans Elias Josephsen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumen is the latest Elixir framework to improve the ease of use for front-end use cases. It is a new compiler and runtime suitable for any BEAM language that is compatible with WebAssembly. In this talk, Hans introduces the Lumen project with a specific focus on the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkA9rtMPyBs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Membrane Framework - Marcin Lewandowski&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media processing requires a large amount of data, a huge variety of formats, protocols and standards. This has always made it challenging to work with. In this talk, Marcin Lewandowski, creator of the Membrane Elixir Framework, demonstrates how it can be used to process multimedia without headaches, using an example from media streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJjrEaZZ72Y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pelemay - Susumu Yamazaki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pelamay has been available since mid-May 2020. It can compile Enum.map in parallel with an integer and (or) a float calculation or String.replace into native code with SIMD instructions. The result is an increase in speed from Enum of between2.25x to 4.48x. In this talk, Susumu Yamazaki, Pelemay’s co-creator shows of what Pelemay can do with demonstrations as well as discussing something that we will see in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

You like specifications, protocols, codecs, or arbitrary binary strings? Then this session is for you. The session will go through the mindset and tooling for investigating how to bring arbitrary unknown bitstrings to messages with meaning, and why Erlang is a really good fit for it. At last OTC, a library for for decoding certain telecom protocols and messages, will be presented. There will be a bunch of acronyms in this talk because the telecom industry really likes them, but similar to complex binaries, all those acronyms can be debunked: don't be afraid.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Increased curiosity when encountering bytes and bitstrings, and means to figure out the meaning of them.

Bondy is an open source, always-on and scaleable application networking platform connecting all elements of a distributed applicationâ€”offering service and event mesh capabilities combined such as service authentication, fine-grained authorisation, service discovery, routed remote procedure calls (RPC) and publish/subscribe.

From web and mobile apps to IoT devices and backend microservices, Bondy allows everything to talk using an open, simple and secured application networking protocol that provides two-way communications and peer-2-peer programming model (WAMP - the Web Application Messaging Protocol). 

Bondy is written in Erlang and uses Partisan for scalable clustering and distribution.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Learn how Bondy offers an alternative approach to building distributed applications, removing the complexity of integrating countless infrastructure components, protocols, and clients found within the CNCF ecosystem.
- Learn how Bondy enables new forms of distributed application interactions through a peer-to-peer programming model and how it solves the reverse-VPN problem for cloud-to-edge communication.
- Understand key Bondy concepts, such as Realms, routed RPC, Pub/Sub, and API Gateways.
- Learn how to use Bondy through a hands-on demonstration.
Discover Bondy's roadmap.

**Target Audience:**
- Developers who want to rediscover the joy of developing distributed applications. 
- Developers who are searching for a real-time, two-way communication solution that works across the whole stack (front, back and embedded). 
- Managers interested in increasing time-to-market and developer morale. 
- BEAM developers interested in contributing to an OSS project.

The CNCF xRegistry project is an offspring of the graduated CNCF CloudEvents project, motivated by the need to formally declare which events can be raised by services and which are available to handle. This session provides an overview of the xRegistry metadata model, its API and the mirroring document format, dives into reference implementations, explains its use in products, and shows you how you can leverage xRegistry to build robust and type-safe event pipelines.

**Talk objectives:**
- Introduce xRegistry, the metadata store designed in the CNCF, by the same folks that built CloudEvents, which will become foundational Microsoft's Azure and Fabric streaming and messaging platforms.

**Target Audience:**
- All messaging users and experts.

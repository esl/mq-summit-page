title: "Bridging the Gap: Developing a UoM Library in Erlang and Overcoming Personal Challenges"
speakers: -_participants/barbara-chassoul.md

---
Erlang’s lack of a standardized approach to unit management poses challenges for developers. This project addresses this by developing a versatile UoM library. I will explore core functionalities, including unit definitions, conversion mechanisms, and consistency checks.

The library’s integration within the GRiSP ecosystem will be showcased, providing practical insights into its architecture and documentation.

This talk also offers a human perspective on using this project to confront personal fears and validate my worth beyond utilitarian productivity. By sharing my journey of battling depression and burnout, I aim to inspire others facing similar challenges and foster a supportive community dialogue about mental health in the tech industry.

This session is ideal for developers interested in improving code quality and handling measurement units in Erlang, as well as those interested in the intersection of mental health and professional development.

**Key Takeaways:**
- This project is both a technical endeavor and a personal journey, undertaken to address the need for a dedicated Units of Measurement (UoM) library in Erlang and to confront my own fears and doubts about becoming an Erlang developer. While the library fills a gap in the Erlang ecosystem, it has also been a means of self-discovery and resilience amidst my struggles with depression and burnout.
- This library simplifies unit operations, enables seamless conversions, and enforces consistency, crucial for reliable calculations and data analysis. Attendees will learn about the architecture and core functionalities. I will discuss how this project integrates with the GRiSP ecosystem, enhancing IoT applications.
- Beyond its technical merits, this project has been a personal test of my capabilities and determination. It represents a defiance against the pressures of a capitalistic and utilitarian system, providing a way to reclaim my value and face my fears through creation and contribution to the Erlang community.

**Target Audience:**
1. Erlang Developers in general.
2. Developers and engineers from other programming backgrounds, interested in learning about Erlang or exploring new libraries and frameworks for handling units of measurement.
3. Developers working on IoT projects who need reliable and consistent unit management for sensor data and other measurements.
4. Attendees interested in the intersection of mental health and professional life, particularly how personal challenges can impact and be impacted by professional projects.
5. Participants who are interested in diverse and human-centric stories that combine technical achievement with personal growth and resilience.

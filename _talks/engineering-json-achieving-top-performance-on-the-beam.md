OTP 27 includes a new module for handling JSON. It provides performance significantly exceeding existing pure-Erlang and Elixir libraries, and sometimes even beating NIFs written in C. Furthermore, it offers a more flexible and adaptable API which allows for new applications.
In this talk, we'll have a brief look at the new module, and explore how it was possible to achieve the speed and flexibility it offers. We'll look at various tips & tricks for building performant Erlang and Elixir libraries and finally, we'll explore tools that can be used to aid in that.

**Key Takeaways:**
- How to use the new json module from OTP 27
- How to build high performance libraries in Erlang & Elixir
- What tools can be used to understand performance on the BEAM

**Target Audience:**
- Erlang & Elixir engineers interested in understanding the performance intricacies of the BEAM, likely engineers with more experience with the platform, rather than total beginners.

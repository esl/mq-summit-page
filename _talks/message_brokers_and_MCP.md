The model context protocol (MCP) is a new open standard that enables AI models to integrate with external systems in a standardized way. This session explores the transformative potential of combining MCP with popular message brokers like RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ to create powerful Agentic AI workflows. We will explore how the unique messaging capabilities of each message broker are presented as accessible tools for AI agents, enabling seamless communication and task execution. Through examples, learn how to safely integrate MCP-enabled brokers into your existing technology stack while maintaining security standards and operational reliability. Whether you're an architect, developer, or technical leader, you'll gain valuable insights into harnessing the combined power of MCP and message brokers to advance your AI integration initiatives.

**Talk objectives:**
- The audience will learn how to setup their message broker as an MCP server to integrate with their AI model, how to surface the existing capabilities of the broker to different agents in an operationally safe and secure manner, and best practices for building multi-agent systems

**Target Audience:**
- Technical leaders, architects, and developers focused on integrating Generative AI

NATS is a versatile messaging system with a sweet spot in distributed and edge deployments.

NATS supports a variety of communication patterns across such a distributed architecture. It can replace REST services without the need to open firewalls or use complex API gateways, or replicate and move message streams between locations, all while allowing for security barriers between NATS clusters and secure multi-tenant application hosting.

Schaeffler has harnessed the power of NATS to build a robust messaging backbone that spans over 100 plants worldwide. With multiple clusters strategically distributed across global regions, NATS enables seamless processing of billions of messages daily from thousands of clients.

More than 50 custom applications, ranging from Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and edge devices to distributed apps and our central SAP system, leverage NATS for efficient and secure data transmission.

**Talk objectives:**
- How to design a highly distributed, operationally resilient and security messaging mesh, suitable for industrial use cases.

**Target Audience:**

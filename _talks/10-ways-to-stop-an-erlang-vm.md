Erlang systems are meant to be running non-stop. But sometimes you just need to get out of the VM and that may be a little… let's say… unintuitive.

Do you have an Erlang VM that you don’t need anymore and you don’t know what to do with it? Did you turn on an Erlang VM by mistake? Do you want to prank your Erlanger friend by remotely turning off their servers [NOT RECOMMENDED]?

Worry not, my friend, this is just the talk for you! Fasten your seatbelt and get into your old fridges… we’re going to crash and blow things up!!

**Key Takeaways:**
- This is not a super-smart talk. It's not a groundbreaking one, either. But it will certainly be a funny one and you may end up learning a thing or two about the Erlang shell and the Erlang VM, in general.

**Target Audience:**
- Everybody, even people that know nothing about Erlang.

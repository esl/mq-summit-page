Messaging gateways need to adapt to modern organization challenges. Organizations that require multi-location connectivity, hybrid-cloud or multi-cloud deployments need to deploy and manage messaging gateways and application connectivity to the gateway in a way that reduces human touch points, provides self-service, and limits the need to change and redeploy code.

This session will quickly introduce messaging gateway architecture, provide an overview of how it is changed and what capabilities are needed for modern platform teams to deliver on excellence.

**Talk objectives:**
- Attendees will learn what a messaging gateway architecture is, what problems it solves, and what use cases it is best suited.

A short trip through historically how early messaging gateways worked and how modern challenges require new capabilities in order for organizations to be successful long term-- this goes beyond technically what messaging system can do and requires gateway solutions to address scaling of the message throughput, but also scaling platform ops team and keeping a handle on costs.

**Target Audience:**
- Directors, architects, platform ops, DevOps and senior software engineers.

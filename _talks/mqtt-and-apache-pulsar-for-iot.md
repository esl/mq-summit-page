This presentation explores robust messaging solutions for the Internet of Things, focusing on MQTT and Apache Pulsar.  We'll begin with MQTT as the de facto lightweight pub/sub protocol for edge communication, detailing its strengths and limitations. Then, we'll dive into Apache Pulsar, a scalable, durable streaming platform ideal for IoT backend infrastructure, highlighting its unique architecture. Finally, we'll examine how MQTT and Pulsar can be combined, particularly through MQTT-on-Pulsar (MoP), to create a unified IoT data streaming pipeline.

**Target Audience:**

Data Streaming Architects

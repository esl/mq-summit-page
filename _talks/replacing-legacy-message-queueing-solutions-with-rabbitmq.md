One of the original motivations for AMQP was to address the middleware hell that had plagued organizations for decades due to the lack of open standards and the existence of proprietary and expensive message queuing products that did not interoperate, necessitating the development of adaptors and gateways that were costly to implement and maintain. However, while AMQP was originally conceived to help solve this existing problem, the protocol and products like RabbitMQ that evolved from it have largely been applied to solving new problems. This then raises the question as to whether RabbitMQ is equally applicable to the solution of traditional integration problems involving legacy software as it is to these newer problems.

This talk aims to consider the viability and benefits of replacing proprietary legacy solutions with RabbitMQ. Such modernization initiatives will be discussed in the context of specific use-cases, and solutions to common problems will be considered.

**Talk objectives:**
- To describe how RabbitMQ can be used to modernize legacy application environments.

**Target Audience:**
- General audience. Most relevant to people interested in using RabbitMQ (or LavinMQ) as an alternative to proprietary message queueing solutions in legacy environments.

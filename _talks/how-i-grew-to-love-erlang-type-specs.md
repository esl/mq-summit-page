Erlang is a typeless language, but our programs have types. Large teams and long running projects need to communicate how our programs work. Typing structures and functions beyond the Erlang base types makes code easier to understand, change, and debug. This talk covers how I grew from finding type specs an annoyance to loving them.

**Key Takeaways:**
- overview of type specs
- good and bad type specs
- improve code through clear type specs
- becoming a better engineer

**Target Audience:**
- Erlang developers
- code maintainers

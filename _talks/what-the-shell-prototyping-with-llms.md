With OTP-26 we've launched a number of improvements to the shell that we hope is appreciated by the Erlang Community.
* Multiline expressions
* Function definitions
* Module creation (26.1)
* Type completions
* Keyboard shortcut configurations (26.1)
This presentation introducers these features by initiating a conversation with ChatGPT erlang module in the shell, to write functions for some kind of app.
Copy pasting the function definition response with a -spec into the shell, maybe even a couple of tests.
We will iteratively complete the function or app with the help of ChatGPT, tracing, type completions and open an external editor (VSCode) connected to LSP.

**Key Takeaways:**
- How to prototype Erlang modules and apps in the shell using new shell features, with the help of LLMs or StackOverflow.

**Target Audience:**
- Developers using the shell to prototype their apps.

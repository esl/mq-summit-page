Queues are a valuable part of life. We naturally integrate them into how we operate in so many ways, and this has been true in software for decades too. However, in recent years there has been a school of thought that queuing doesn’t solve today’s problems, and every queue can (and should) be replaced with an API or an event stream. Challenging the status quo is healthy, but developers are now rediscovering why queues are often the right choice and realising that alternatives, which may bring certain values, can lead to significant sacrifices elsewhere. In this talk we will look at what makes a queue a queue, the pros and cons against alternatives, and how ultimately you need to pick the right tool for the job.

**Target Audience:**

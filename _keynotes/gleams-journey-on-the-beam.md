title: Gleam's journey on the BEAM
audience:
- Everyone

---
Erlang was designed to solve a very specific problem at a very specific point in time. That problem has shaped Erlang, the runtime, and the ecosystem around.

The world has since changed, and Ericsson's once-niche problem of concurrent scalable systems is common place and more  people than ever are drawn to the BEAM.

With new people has come new problems to solve, new desires, and new ideas for how we can use and enrich the Erlang ecosystem. Gleam is one new aspect of this evolving ecosystem, and in this talk we will look at how it was shaped by the BEAM, and some of the stories around it, and how Gleam is opening up the BEAM to a whole new group of developers."

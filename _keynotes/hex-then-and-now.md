Hex is the package manager for the Erlang ecosystem. It has been started in 2013 by Eric Meadows-JÃ¶nsson and officially announced alongside Elixir v0.13.0 in 2014. What changed about Hex, the package ecosystem, the community over the last decade? What did _not_ change? In this talk we'll go through major milestones in Hex's development and ecosystem and see what we can learn from them.

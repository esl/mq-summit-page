title: "Developing Mobile Apps - From LiveView to AppStore"

---
During this course we want to walk participants through creating a simple LiveView application locally, package it and release as a AppStore package (or GooglePlay Android package) using https://github.com/elixir-desktop/.

**Training objectives:**
The goal of this training is to enable participants to create their own mobile applications using Elixir LiveView and be able to ship them to customers.

**Training audience:**
LiveView enthusiasts who are curious or have a business need to ship to mobile. Might also be applicable to LiveView newcomers as the sample application will be very basic.

**Training prerequisites:**
Bring a MacBook (AppStore submision) or Linux (Android Submission) laptop - also please install Android Studio / XCode before the session.

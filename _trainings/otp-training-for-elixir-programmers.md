title: OTP Training for Elixir Programmers
venue: innoQ, Ohlauer Str. 43

---
You've built and deployed a Phoenix application backed by Ecto and Postgres, and you've realized you love it. Now, you're ready to take the next step. This hands-on training is designed for you. You'll dive deep into the inner workings of building applications using OTP behaviours, exploring the proven abstractions necessary for creating back-end, fault-tolerant systems that can run for years and scale to billions of users. The course includes ample lab time, allowing you to hone your skills and apply theory to practice, with about half of the class dedicated to lab work or coding alongside your instructor.

**Format**
3-day in-person training

**Training objectives:**
Gain a deeper understanding of how to architect back-end systems and micro-services accessible from Phoenix. Learn why behaviours such as Generic Servers, Generic State Machines, and others are necessary, when to use them, and how to integrate them into supervision trees. Acquire knowledge on dealing with load issues by applying techniques like pooling, circuit breakers, and producer/consumer solutions. Additionally, develop a comprehensive understanding of how an application works, how to create them, and how to ensure they work seamlessly together.

**Target audience:**
Software Developers, Engineers and Architects who must understand basic knowledge of sequential and concurrent Elixir

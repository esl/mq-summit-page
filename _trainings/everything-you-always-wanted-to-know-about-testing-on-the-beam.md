title: Everything you Need to Know about Testing in Erlang… and a bit of Elixir, as well
published: true
venue: nhow Berlin, Stralauer Allee 3

---
During the training, we will start with the basics: you will first learn how to apply Test-Driven Development to your first Erlang projects and how to use this methodology as a tool to learn the language.

Then, we will switch our focus to the most commonly used test frameworks: EUnit and Common Test. We will talk about their characteristics and give some recommendations to determine when and how to use each one of them.

We will later focus on some scenarios that are particular to Erlang, and we will explain how to write good tests for them. We will cover the writing of tests for…

* Asynchronous processes with side-effects.
* Implementations of OTP behaviours.
* Custom behaviour definition and implementations.
* Modules with external dependencies.
* Multi-node systems.

To conclude, we will shift our attention to Property-Based Testing, and we will talk about how this testing methodology can be used to better test your software; we’ll explain the ins and outs of how to use a PBT tool, such as PropEr, the differences between stateless and stateful properties, and when to use each.

You will leave the training with a new-found (or a reinvigorated) passion for testing, and with more tools in your repertoire to catch bugs in the future to come!

**Format**
1-day in-person tutorial

**OBJECTIVES:**
Through this training, the students will learn everything they need to know in order to start writing well-tested and, therefore, more maintainable Erlang systems.

**AUDIENCE**
Everybody, from people who are just learning Erlang for the first time to experts willing to improve their system design and code writing skills. Basically, anybody who wants to create more maintainable and robust systems.

I am BÃ¡rbara Chassoul, a 33-year-old developer from Costa Rica. In 2013, I began my programming career while studying physics. The need to work prompted me to dive into the coding world, starting as a frontend developer. In 2018, recommended by my brother, I discovered the Erlang ecosystem and immediately fell in love with its unique capabilities and community. Despite facing challenges transitioning from JavaScript to Erlang, I have grown to appreciate and enjoy the process. I am finishing my bachelor's degree in physics, and my project on developing a Units of Measurement library in Erlang is part of this degree, bridging my passion for science and technology.

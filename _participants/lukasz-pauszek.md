Łukasz is an Elixir consultant by day and a specialty coffee enthusiast in the mornings. He has worked with Elixir and Phoenix for the last few years, recently venturing into Phoenix LiveView territory. He is currently involved in a project involving Elixir, Phoenix, Kafka, and CockroachDB. In his spare time, you can find him tinkering with his Nvim configuration, playing PS5 games, or assembling Gunpla models. When he is not drinking coffee, that is.

NobbZ' passion for programming began in the late 1980s when he animated ASCII characters on his dad's C64. Since then, he has been deeply immersed in programming. The lack of functional programming aspects in Ruby led him to Erlang during his university days, and he has remained close to BEAM languages ever since.
NobbZ currently works at BravoBike, enhancing the process management software written in Elixir. When seeing code, he either admires its beauty or sees opportunities for refactoring and improving, which is rooted in his helpful nature. 
His helpfulness extends to his personal life, where he cares for his family or relaxes from his programming job by programming

Having studied mechanical engineering in Cape Town, Dylan eventually realised that working with software was much more attractive than working with hardware.
He got yanked into a job at Zappi, a Ruby on Rails house which built automated market research products. 5 years later, his CTO convinced him to give Elixir a try for his newest project, and within a month he was hooked.
Now an avid (stubborn) advocate for all things Elixir and Phoenix, he spends half his time managing a team working in Elixir, half writing Elixir, and half trying to convince other teams to use Elixir.

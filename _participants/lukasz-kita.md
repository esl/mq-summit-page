Łukasz is a Software Engineer specializing in multimedia processing, currently working on the Membrane Framework at Software Mansion in Kraków. Fuelled by an insatiable passion for software development never shies away from diving into its theoretical fundamentals. A devoted fan of the functional paradigm.
Treats RFC documents and ITU standards as if they were riveting novels (not exactly, he might be just kidding now). On a personal front, Łukasz is an avid appreciator of painting and architecture, and when not in the digital realm, chances are he's taking on mountains as an alpine tourism enthusiast.

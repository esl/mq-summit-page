Quinn is an applied researcher at Fission, where she spends her time at the intersection of programming language theory and distributed systems, while thinking about new ways to build and compose systems together.

Her specialty lies in bridging the gap between the historical context software is embedded in, and the ways in which an ever-changing world recontextualizes that software in new ways.

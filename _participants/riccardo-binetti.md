Riccardo started his career as an embedded developer, but switched to backend development as soon as he discovered Elixir.

He's currently using the power of the BEAM to develop Astarte, an open source IoT Data Ingestion platform, and Edgehog, an open source fleet management solution.

On the community front, he's one of the organizers of the Erlang, Elixir and Friends devroom at FOSDEM and the co-founder of the Elixir Meetup Padova.

Like many of you, Merlin loves to write code, and is a big fan of software in all its forms.

Having worked his way up from hardware design, through embedded software, to web technologies he’s seen plenty of approaches, but has chosen functional programming as his style of choice. With a strong interest in distributed systems, Elixir & BEAM became an obvious technology to focus on.
At Multiverse he helps to lead software architecture initiatives, runs a team, and sometimes if he’s very lucky, gets to use a code editor.

Software Engineer is one hat he wears, and he’s also rock climber, competition skydiver, and beer brewer!

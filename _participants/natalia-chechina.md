Natalia Chechina is passionate about distributed systems, scalability, fault tolerance, and as a result is in love with the Erlang Ecosystem. Before joining Erlang Solutions as a senior developer, she was a research fellow and lecturer at UK Universities, focusing on approaches and techniques to enable scaling and efficient performance on commodity hardware where components are loosely coupled, communication is significant, and any of the components may fail or disconnect at any time. She has a PhD from Heriot Watt University, UK.

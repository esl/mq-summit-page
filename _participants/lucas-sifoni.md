Indie developer since 2015, mainly collaborating in a close setting with graphic designers on design & data automation systems in the field of architecture. We're trying to achieve a balance between depending on designers, autonomy, and rightful application of design systems, for architecture teams. Aside from computers, I've slowly been experimenting in the field of optics and astronomy, and now find myself longing for cloud-less nights to share celestial views with others.

Paweł is a backend developer interested mostly in big distributed systems. He discovered Erlang and Elixir at the university course and that's when the seed of actor concurrency model and functional programming was planted in his mind. That's why later, after 3 years of programming in Java and Kotlin he decided that he should change his tech stack and started working with Erlang and Elixir. In free time he enjoys many geek activities like board games, ttrpgs or painting miniatures.

Founder, Board Member Erlang Ecosystem Foundation.
Around it he found the best developer community one could wish for being part of. He is Founder and Director of Peer Stritzinger GmbH which created GRiSP www.grisp.org, a platform to run Erlang on small embedded systems focusses on building Automotive, Railway and Industrial IoT applications. Integrating with that is GRiSP.io a novel heterogenous compute platform to span Cloud, Edge and IoT/Fog. Participating in several EU funded research projects, he is trying to push the envelope for what can be done with Erlang and the other languages in the Ecosystem running on the BEAM (Erlang VM). He initially mastered in physics at the Technical University Munich. He has been working self-employed as a developer since 1987 and also consulted in applied cryptography and protocol design and implementation. He is since ever living and working in the idyllic countryside west of Munich, Bavaria.

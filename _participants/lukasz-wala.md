Łukasz is a Software Engineer at Software Mansion and co-creator of Jellyfish. Currently working on multimedia streaming solutions as a part of the Membrane Framework Team. He has come to love Elixir and continually tries to explore new quirks and features of BEAM and functional programming. Probably ricing his UNIX desktop or optimising his Neovim workflow (instead of doing the actual work) in his free time.

Jade has been a software developer and dev-ops person for a really long time. She is interested in functional programming, distributed computing and computing history topics. In 2010, she discovered Erlang and has been hooked ever since. Recently, she has been focused more on devops than pure development work, and spends her day in Python, Bash and CLIs (alas).

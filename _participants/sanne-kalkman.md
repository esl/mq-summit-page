Sanne is a former teacher turned software engineer. Currently, she works at CodeSandbox, where she's one of two Elixir developers responsible for the backend. When she's not coding, you'll probably find her either 25 browser tabs deep into a new CS topic, learning yet another new hobby (the current one is 3d art), or behind her sewing machine.

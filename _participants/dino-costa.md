I've been interested in Software Development since my teenage years, when I started to build small games with Flash.
Had my first contact with Elixir at University but was only able to start writing it professionally much later, while at Onfido. I've had the pleasure to work at some pretty interesting startups but I'm now building my own startup with a couple of friends, using Elixir!
In my free time I like to attend music shows and tinker around with things that make noise like synths and grooveboxes ðŸŽ¹

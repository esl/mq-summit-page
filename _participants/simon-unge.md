I'm a humble Software Developer who started my programming career over 12 years ago. I usually ends up working the backend with the Erlang Programming Language. I've writing Network Orchestration Software at Cisco, making sure chat messages are delivered correctly with ejabberd at Zoom, and now finally working with Open Source in the form of RabbitMQ at Amazon AWS!

Privately I love cars, but I don't know anything about them.

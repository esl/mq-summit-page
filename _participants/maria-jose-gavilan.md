Passionate about people, their organizational methods, creative processes, and the need for communication and community. I run a private practice in San Jos√©, providing therapy and developing treatment plans. My journey into psychology began with a Licentiate from UCACIS and a diploma in Art Therapy from UAM, sparking my interest in connecting psychoanalysis with art. In 2015, I co-founded Kunsthilft in Berlin, offering therapeutic art workshops for refugee children. I combine my expertise in psychology with project management, bringing a unique perspective to my work.

Robin Morisset did his PhD on the interaction between compiler optimizations and the C++ memory model. This included some work fuzzing GCC to find optimisations that are right for a single-threaded program but wrong for a multi-threaded one.
Afterwards he worked for 4 years at Apple in the JavaScriptCore team, which is responsible for the JITs at the heart of Safari. During that time he observed the unreasonable effectiveness of having a fuzzer as part of a compiler's CI.
He's been working at WhatsApp for a year on a team dedicated to the Erlang ecosystem, and one of his first contributions is erlfuzz which is the topic of his talk at Code BEAM.

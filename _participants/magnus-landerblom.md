Developer who prefer functional languages and low level coding. I've working in the message queues landscape for 8 years and can safely say that that is the best way to build a system.

When I'm not in front of the computer I drive my kids to all kinds of sports, I also love being out on the ocean so my hobby is volunteering as a sea rescuer where I spend probably way to much time.

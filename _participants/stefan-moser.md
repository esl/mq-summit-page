Stefan is a Principal Engineer at AWS on the Amazon MQ team where he obsesses over a large fleet of RabbitMQ brokers. He has been an advocate and teacher of messaging patterns and distributed systems design for well over a decade. When his fingers are not on a keyboard, they’re likely wrapped around the handlebars of his mountain bike, holding on for dear life while hurtling down one of the North Shore’s world-famous trails.

Paul learned programming with 6502 in the 1980s, wrote drivers and eventually a full system emulator of Apple Newton Messagepads which was first released in 2004. He eventually graduated with a Ph.D. in Artficial Intelligence in 2006 and fell in love with Erlang when he introduced ejabberd to power Nabaztag wifi rabbits as the CTO of Violet in 2007. For a decade, he led Semiocast, a data science boutique consultancy using Erlang and Elixir to crawl and process the web. An open source advocate and hobbyist, he's been a contributor to various Erlang projects and had recently a lot of fun working with AtomVM developers.

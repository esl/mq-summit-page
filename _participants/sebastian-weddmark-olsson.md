First encountered Erlang in university, and got hooked on it ever since. Worked as an Erlang developer in multiple industries in companies of different sizes. What really tickles me is trying to understand how protocols work.

Other hobbies include coding (not necessarily in Erlang; anyone mentioned COBOL?), and ingesting beers, going to concerts and festivals, especially if there is metal of the darker kind involved.

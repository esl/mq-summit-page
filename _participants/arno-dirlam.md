Arno has been using Elixir since 2016, when he was blown away by the elegance and simplicity that Elixir brings to the table. Now, he helps software engineering teams make the most of Elixir and its wonderful ecosystem. He's repeatedly experienced first-hand, how quickly developers pick up this language and become productive with it. Arno's role is to help facilitate this learning process and evolve teams, both in size and knowledge, to enable them to continuously deliver features and improvements without compromising on long-term maintainability of the code base.

Starting with backend development in Kotlin & SpringBoot at a pet health insurance startup, I then transitioned to data analysis in a leading supermarket chain. Along the way, I discovered Elixir and the BEAM languages through university and the Stack Overflow survey, where Elixir/Phoenix stood out as beloved frameworks. Now, I'm in the world of BEAM languages at Peer Stritzinger GmbH, specializing in Erlang solutions for embedded systems. Inspired by the kindness and collaboration spirit of the Elixir community, I'm dedicated to cultivating that same culture of kindness and cooperation into every thing I do.

In my spare time, I enjoy volunteering with Hello Sisters!, an organization dedicated to supporting women in computer science. I'm also a co-organizer for the Anita Borg conferences. I'm studying psychology, and I like to pursue completely different hobbies whenever I get the chance.

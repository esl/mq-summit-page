Michał is a long-term Elixir and Erlang enthusiast, recently working from London at WhatsApp to improve developer productivity and engineering efficiency.

In the past, Michał was involved with many Elixir libraries, including Ecto and Jason, and was an Elixir core-team member. His interest in the BEAM focuses around performance and efficiency, proving that functional doesn't mean slow.

When not programming, he enjoys reading, travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy. It's even better if all of those are combined!

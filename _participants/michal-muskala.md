Software engineer @ WhatsApp focusing on supporting Erlang and Erlang tooling for internal users. Involved with the open-source erlfmt & eqWAlizer projects. He also contributes to multiple independent open source projects including Elixir and OPT and maintains some of his own including Jason - the most popular project on hex.pm.

When not programming, he enjoys reading, travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy. It's even better if all of those are combined!
